# BrokenLineShellings

To get started using broken line shelling orders to produce new posets recording the h-vector of a matroid, we recommend using Cocalc.com, as this can used from any internet browser without any installation. To get started with Cocalc [go here](https://doc.cocalc.com/getting-started.html).

After logging into Cocalc, simply download the file `shellings.sage` and then upload it to your current Cocalc project folder.

Open a new sage worksheet in Cocalc and type `load("shellings.sage")` as your first command. After that you will have access to all the functions defined in the `shellings.sage` file.
